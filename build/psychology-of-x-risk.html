									Most people initially respond to the topic of AI existential risk with a mix of

									The psychology of existential risk is a topic that is not often discussed,
									compared to the technical aspects of AI safety. However, one might argue that it
									is perhaps just as important. After all, if we can’t get people to take the topic

								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-1382bod">
									It’s hard to <strong>bring up</strong>, hard to <strong>believe</strong>, hard to

									In the past year, the majority of the population was introduced to the concept of
									existential risk from AI. When hearing about this, people will look for an
									explanation. The correct explanation is that AI is in fact dangerous, but
									believing this is difficult and scary: it will lead to a lot of cognitive
									friction. So people will almost directly look for a different way to explain their
									observations. There are two alternative explanations that are much easier to
									believe:
								</p>
								<ol data-svelte-h="svelte-1y8w0mi">
									<li>
										<strong>It’s all a big conspiracy</strong>. AI companies are hyping up AI to get
										more funding, and AI safety people are just part of this hype machine. This
										narrative matches with various observations: companies often lie, many AI safety
										folk are employed by AI companies, and there are a bunch of billionaires who are
										financing AI safety research. However, we can also point out why this conspiracy
										story is simply not true. Many of the alarmists are scientists who have nothing
										to gain. The companies might benefit in some way, but up until very recently
										(May 2023), they have been almost completely silent about AI risks. This makes
										sense, as companies mostly do not benefit from people fearing for their product
										or service. We’ve been protesting outside of Microsoft and OpenAI partly
										<em>because</em> we wanted them to acknowledge the risks.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>It’s a cult</strong>. The group that believes in AI safety is just a
										bunch of crazy religious extremists who believe in the end of the world. This
										seems to fit, too, since people in the AI safety community are often very
										passionate about the topic and use all sorts of in-group jargon. However, it
										falls apart when you point out that people who warn of AI risks are not a single
										organization. It’s a large, diverse group of people, there is no single leader,
										there are no rituals, and there is no dogma.
									</li>
								</ol>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-1rgi8tq">
									What makes these explanations so compelling is not just that they are easy to
									comprehend, or that they explain all observations perfectly - the primary reason

								<p>
									We see faces in clouds, and we see human-like qualities in AI systems. Millions of
									years of evolution have made us highly social creatures, but these instincts are
									not always helpful. We tend to think of AIs as having human-like goals and
									motivations, being able to feel emotions, and having a sense of morality. We tend
									to expect a very intelligent AI to also be very wise and kind. This is one of the
									reasons why people intuitively think that AI alignment is easy, and why the

									AI safety uses complex language
								</h3>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-5m5kq1">
									The AI safety field consists mostly of a small group of (smart) people who have
									developed their own jargon. Reading LessWrong posts can feel like reading a
									foreign language. Many posts assume the reader is already familiar with
									mathematical concepts, various technical concepts, and the jargon of the field.

								<h2 id="difficult-to-act-on" data-svelte-h="svelte-hdzpf9">Difficult to act on</h2>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-1d7ulsn">
									Even if people do understand the arguments, it is still difficult to act on them.
									The impact is too large, we have coping mechanisms that downplay the risks, and if
									we do feel the gravity of the situation, we can feel powerless.
								</p>

									Lack of innate fear response
								</h3>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-ka5k2p">
									Our brains have evolved to fear things that are dangerous. We instinctively fear
									heights, big animals with sharp teath, sudden loud noises, and things that move
									around in an S-shape. A superintelligent AI does not hit any of our primal fears.
									Additionally, we have a strong fear for social rejection or losing social status,
									which means that people tend to be afraid of speaking up about AI risks.

								<blockquote data-svelte-h="svelte-g78uj7">
									<p>
										“A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.” - Joseph Stalin
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-8m457a">
									Scope insensitivity is the human tendency to underestimate the impact of large
									numbers. We do not care 10x as much about 1000 people dying as we do about 100
									people dying. Existential risk means the death of all 8 billion people on Earth
									(not counting their descendants).
								</p>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-1w5t8s6">
									Even if there is a 1% chance of this happening, it is still a very big deal.
									Rationally, we should consider this 1% chance of 8 billion deaths just as
									important as the certain death of 80 million people.
								</p>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-iyrjom">
									If someone feels like the end of the world isn’t that big of a deal (you would be
									sur€prised by how often this happens), you can try to make things more personal.
									Humanity isn’t just some abstract concept, they are your friends, your family, and
									yourself. All the people you care about will die.

									Our behavior is shaped by our environment and primitive minds
								</h3>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-18gchzx">
									Our actions are conditioned by what is seen as normal, good and reasonable. No
									matter how much we may want to act in a situation that calls for it, if those
									actions are uncommon, a lot of the time we consciously or unconsciously fear being
									excluded by society for doing them. And what’s normal is pushed into our minds by
									being surrounded by it in our close social circles and online feeds. People just
									doing and talking about stuff unrelated to what we actually care about will
									override what’s in our minds and motivate us to do other stuff on a daily basis.
								</p>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-1u9p3nm">
									Extinction risks deserve a <strong>lot</strong> more of our time, energy and
									attention. Our reactions to them should be more like life-or-death situations that
									fill us with adrenaline. But, because of the abstract nature of the problems and
									our maladapted minds, most people who learn about them just end up carrying on
									with their days as if they have learned nothing.

									Coping mechanisms (preventing action)
								</h3>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-meie2v">
									The same coping mechanisms that prevent people from <em>believing</em> in
									existential risk also prevent them from <em>acting</em> on it. If you’re in denial
									or compartmentalizing, you won’t feel the need to do anything about it.
								</p>
								<h3 id="stress-and-anxiety" data-svelte-h="svelte-1rat0ns">Stress and anxiety</h3>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-5iyz3l">
									As I’m writing this, I’m feeling stressed and anxious. It’s not just because I
									fear the end of the world, but also because I feel like I have to do something
									about it. There’s a lot of pressure to act, and it can be overwhelming. This
									stress can be a good motivator, but it can also be paralyzing.

									Hopelessness and powerlessness
								</h3>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-182z53k">
									When people do take the topic seriously, and the full gravity of the situation
									sinks in, they can feel like all hope is lost. It can feel like a cancer
									diagnosis: you are going to die sooner than you wanted, and there is nothing you
									can do about it. The problem is too big to tackle, and you are too small. Most
									people are no AI safety experts or experienced lobbyists, so how can they possibly
									do anything about it?
								</p>
								<h2 id="but-you-can-help" data-svelte-h="svelte-nbdlss">But you can help!</h2>
								<p>
									There are many <a href="/action">things that you can do </a>. Writing a letter,
									going to a protest, donating some money or joining a community is not that hard!
									And these actions have a real impact. Even when facing the end of the world, there
									can still be hope and very rewarding work to do.
