									Why is local organizing important?
								</h2>
								<p>
									Local organizing–working with groups of volunteers in local communities to advance
									a cause–is the heart and soul of the PauseAI movement. Right now, we have
									volunteers in <a href="/communities">dozens of cities around the world </a>, and
									we expect this number to grow.
								</p>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-1yyxf7o">
									Effective local organizing can be much more impactful than ineffective local
									organizing. We’ve seen the kind of impact that effective organizing can have, as
									shown by the grassroots movements that have changed the course of history. In
									other words, it’s important to do this right.
								</p>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-9jaobt">
									This guide will walk you through the ins and outs of local organizing, such as
									recruiting volunteers, staging events, building coalitions, and more. You should
									come away from this guide armed with these tools and prepared to become a local
									organizer.
								</p>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-5tvvdg">Good luck. The future is yours.</p>

									Developing a Local Campaign Plan
								</h2>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-oha7wh">
									One pitfall that organizers sometimes make is that they’ll start taking action
									without any clear plan. This can lead to unfocused organizing efforts which are
									less effective than they could be. As you’re thinking through the change you want
									to make in your community, it’s important to come up with a plan: what are your
									goals, and what steps are you going to take in order to get there?
								</p>
								<h3 id="goals" data-svelte-h="svelte-kcjgzs">Goals</h3>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-1r2d8bd">
									What do you ultimately want to accomplish? These are your goals. Possible goals
									could include:
								</p>
								<ul data-svelte-h="svelte-19cyiao">
									<li>Raising awareness of AI risks in your community</li>
									<li>Convincing elected officials to publicly support an AI moratorium</li>
									<li>

									</li>
								</ul>
								<h3 id="tactics" data-svelte-h="svelte-1q6juwa">Tactics</h3>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-b0u3nu">
									Working backwards from these goals, how will you accomplish them? These are your
									tactics. Your specific tactics come from the strategy you choose. Initial
									strategies can be fairly high-level, e.g. “I will build up a team of volunteers
									and get them to help run public outreach events.”
								</p>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-1xisfo7">Possible tactics could include:</p>
								<ul data-svelte-h="svelte-knta3">
									<li>Working with teams of volunteers</li>
									<li>Building alliances with community groups</li>
									<li>Running public education events on AI risk</li>
									<li>Generating letters, phone calls, and public comments to elected officials</li>
									<li>Writing to news outlets</li>
									<li>Meeting directly with elected officials’ offices</li>
								</ul>
								<h3 id="personal-fit" data-svelte-h="svelte-1q34y0t">Personal Fit</h3>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-1fp10xc">
									Where do you fit into all of this? You don’t want to bite off more than you can
									chew. Useful questions to ask yourself include:
								</p>
								<ul data-svelte-h="svelte-labjs6">
									<li>
										How many hours per week do I want to spend on this? Knowing this can help
										provide a clear sense of what you can expect to accomplish on a weekly basis.
									</li>
									<li>
										What are my skills? Knowing this can help you determine which aspects of your
										plan you want to focus on, vs. which aspects to delegate to others. Make sure
										you have at least some skill in the areas of the campaign that you want to
										implement.
									</li>
									<li>
										What are my shortcomings? Answering this question can help you find volunteers
										who are strongest in areas where you’re weakest.

									Other best practices for campaign planning
								</h3>
								<ul data-svelte-h="svelte-2hdjgd">
									<li>
										Make sure that each of your preferred tactics fits into your overall goal. For
										instance, if your goal is to convince elected officials to act and your tactics
										include building alliances with community groups, you should have a clear sense
										of why and how building alliances with community groups can lead to elected
										officials being convinced to act.
									</li>
									<li>
										Assigning a numerical value to your goals and tactics can help make your
										planning more concrete. For example, your tactics might include building a team
										of 10 volunteers, writing 50 letters to Congressional offices, publishing 3
										articles in local news outlets, etc.
									</li>
									<li>
										Your campaign plan doesn’t need to be extremely specific. The overall idea is to

								</p>

									pitch people on joining PauseAI. It’s important to have a strong and memorable
									pitch. These can vary in length but generally follow the same structure:
								</p>
								<ul data-svelte-h="svelte-jkzqms">
									<li>
										<strong>Introduction</strong>: Who you are and why you’re here.
										<ul>
											<li>Why are you motivated to act, as an individual? What is your story?</li>
											<li>
												Example: I just started my city’s chapter of PauseAI, and I’m here to share
												more about the risks of advanced AI, how we can prevent these risks, and how
												you can help get involved.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Problem</strong>: What is the problem, and why should your audience care
										about it? How does the problem intersect with the interests of your audience?
										<ul>
											<li>
												What common values are threatened? Why should the audience be motivated to
												act? (You can tailor this section to the interests of your audience. For
												instance, if speaking to a labor group, you might want to talk more about
												automation/job loss from AI.)
											</li>
											<li>
												Example: AI systems are advancing rapidly. AI companies have the goal of
												building systems more intelligent and capable than humans, despite safety
												experts telling us that we don’t know how to control these systems. Human
												disempowerment or extinction is a possible outcome of superhuman-level AI.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Solution</strong>: How can we fix the problem? (This section is more
										about the big-picture vision and less about specific tactics.)
										<ul>
											<li>
												Example: We need a global moratorium on frontier AI development, in order to
												prevent companies from racing ahead to human-level AI and to give us more
												time to figure out how to make these systems safe.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Strategy</strong>: How do we achieve our proposed solution? What does
										our group have to offer to help make this solution happen?
										<ul>
											<li>
												Example: We need to build grassroots support and buy-in from elected
												officials for a moratorium. We can do this by educating the public on the
												risks of AI and meeting with elected officials directly.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Urgency</strong>: Why should people get involved now? What makes this
										cause urgent?
										<ul>
											<li>
												Example: We might not have much time. As AI systems become more capable,
												preventing their further development will be a harder sell. Experts are
												telling us that human-level AI might only be a few years away, and we need
												policies to catch up to the rate of progress.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Call to Action</strong>: How can your audience get involved immediately?
										<ul>
											<li>
												Example: Join our local group’s meeting next Saturday to find out more about
												how you can get involved.

									<li>
										Has a clear sense of their responsibilities to make local organizing efforts go
										well;

									<li>
										Feels empowered and agentic, that they have a stake in the movement as a whole.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-1pgr28n">

								</p>
								<ul data-svelte-h="svelte-1k6zu2u">
									<li>
										Get to know volunteers on an individual level; understand their interests and
										motivations in joining PauseAI.
									</li>
									<li>
										Provide additional context and share a vision of what your local group is trying
										to accomplish.
									</li>
									<li>
										Determine what kind(s) of work volunteers are interested in getting involved

									</li>
									<li>
										Pitch volunteers on specific roles and responsibilities, based on their
										interests.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-77b2kd">
									The overall goal is to come out of these meetings with 1) a clear understanding of

									can take.
								</p>
								<h3 id="team-wide-meetings" data-svelte-h="svelte-1bbzpjb">Team-wide meetings</h3>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-i9x19e">

								</p>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-jnhp5l">
									Ideally, these meetings should last around an hour. Depending on volunteer

								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-f0jn4r">
									A good meeting both: 1) covers the group’s goals and initiatives, and how

								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-1pgxtc0">
									There are several ways to procure free or cheap meeting spaces, as long as you
									plan ahead of time. Here are some ideas.
								</p>
								<ul data-svelte-h="svelte-1t81s3a">
									<li>
										<strong>Public Libraries</strong>: Many libraries offer free meeting rooms for
										community groups, nonprofit organizations, and educational sessions. You may
										need to book in advance and comply with the library’s policies.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Community Centers</strong>: Local community centers often have rooms
										available for use at no cost. These centers aim to support local activities and
										may prioritize local residents and community groups.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Universities and Colleges</strong>: Educational institutions sometimes
										provide free space for meetings, particularly for alumni or community-oriented
										events. Contact the institution’s events department or community relations
										office for more information.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Local Businesses and Cafés</strong>: Some businesses, like cafes and
										bookstores, have spaces that can be used for meetings during off-peak hours.
										It’s often expected that participants will buy something from the establishment.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Online Platforms</strong>: Websites like EventBrite or Facebook Groups
										can be resources for finding shared spaces that are available for free.
										Community boards often list available spaces.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Municipal Buildings</strong>: Town halls and other municipal buildings
										frequently have rooms available for public use. These are typically available
										free of charge but might require proof that the meeting serves a community
										benefit.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Churches and Religious Centers</strong>: Many religious centers are
										happy to offer their space for community or nonprofit gatherings. They might not
										advertise this widely, so it’s worth asking directly.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Parks and Outdoor Venues</strong>: For less formal meetings or
										gatherings, consider a local park. Ensure you check if you need a permit,
										especially for larger groups or special setups.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-i3uf7q">
									When using free spaces, it’s good etiquette to leave the space as you found it and
									to thank the provider. This maintains a good relationship and increases the
									likelihood that the space will be available for future use.

									Note: Best practices for event planning
								</h3>
								<ul data-svelte-h="svelte-1mlsv03">
									<li>
										Invite attendees to public events. If hosting a public-facing event, it’s
										important to do this well in advance. You can set up a Facebook or Meetup event,
										promote the event by sharing it with other groups, and build attendance.
									</li>
									<li>
										Make sure the address you’re providing people gives instructions beyond a street
										address, if needed. For instance, if you’re tabling but don’t have exact
										directions to your table inside the building, a surprising number of new members
										will just give up. A table sign (print photos at Walmart for $1 each) can also
										help significantly.
									</li>
									<li>
										Include a social element to events. Make sure there’s time for social mingling
										and building a sense of community. Include unstructured time on the event agenda
										for people to introduce themselves and mingle.
									</li>
									<li>
										You can also host 100% social events – where there is no agenda or presentation,
										just getting together for food or drinks. Having these events occasionally can
										be a good idea.
									</li>
									<li>
										Always include follow-up and next steps at the end of the event. Give attendees
										a clear sense of what they can do, going forward, to remain involved with
										PauseAI.

									Obstacle 3: your group “fizzles out” due to waning interest from volunteers
								</h3>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-1mxmf7z">
									Volunteers might be initially excited to get involved but lose interest over time.
									This can happen because volunteers don’t feel motivated, don’t like the actions
									that interest them, or simply realize that volunteering isn’t for them.
								</p>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-cx2t0w">
									Some of this is inevitable– not everyone will remain invested at all times– but
									much can be averted.
								</p>
								<p data-svelte-h="svelte-bww8j4"><strong>How to Overcome</strong>:</p>
								<ul data-svelte-h="svelte-xfjdei">
									<li>
										Make sure volunteers feel empowered and agentic. Volunteers need to feel that
										they have a stake in what’s going on, and that their insight matters. This is
										another reason why one-on-one meetings are so important; you can understand
										volunteers’ motivations and work with them accordingly. Similarly, during team
										meetings, always provide ample time for volunteers to propose ideas and provide
										feedback on plans.
									</li>
									<li>
										Do fun activities together. Social events can be a great way to build a sense of
										community among your volunteers.
									</li>
									<li>
										Make sure volunteers are involved with actions they actually enjoy. Don’t have
										the person who enjoys protest organizing write op-eds and the person who enjoys
										writing organize protests. Match tasks with the people interested in taking them
										on.
									</li>
									<li>
										Keep a strategy of continuous recruitment. Rather than having a single
										recruiting burst at the beginning and then not doing any recruitment afterwards,
										it’s better to recruit periodically. This way, even if some people lose interest
										over time, you can bring new volunteers into the fold.
									</li>
								</ul>
